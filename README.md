### description

Termos is my simple special Wordpress Woocommerce theme.
My client needed to create new landing with shop functionality and I created it from scratch based on a PSD template.
In progress of work I used to jquery plugins for the lazy-load images, Fancybox for modal shows and Ajax for loading product.
scss is used for the layout, the content is transmitted by the ACF pro plugin (text type fields, WP editor, etc.); 
feedback form (including sending as a csv file) is a custom, its code is in the functions.php file, ajax function in js/ajax.js
As part of an integrated approach, the WP Yoast SEO plugin was also used with caching and minification plugins.
